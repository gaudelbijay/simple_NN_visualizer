# simple_NN_visualizer
Simple neural network visualiser from coursera project:
        In this project we take `mnist` data from tensorflow libraries and build neural network to predict digits. We build visualizer tools to see the hidden state at every layer of the NN.

`Instruction to run this project`
- first run the neural_network.ipynb file in this repo
- after running this file, two extra files: ml_server.py and app.py files will be created
- first run the ml_server.py 
- run app.py file by command: streamlit run app.py
